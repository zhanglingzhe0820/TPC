IoT Benchmark Suite
========================
This suite has two parts
  a) Cluster Validation 
  b) IoT Benchmark TPCx-IoT benchmark based on YCSB workloads.

Pre-Requisites
==============
a) Cluster of Nodes Running No SQL database which is installed as per distribution requirements
b) Cluster shell such as "clush" or "pdsh" on the admin or client node from where this Benchmark  would be run. 
This is needed for the Cluster Validation utility running  with the Benchmark Suite and also for using multiple clients for loading the database.

===========================

Where to run the benchmark
---------------------------
The benchmark has to be run from any client node which also supports clush (clustershell) 
to all the client nodes. 

Setup
------
Update number of clients in Benchmark_Parameters.sh 
Update the client hostnames in client_host_list.txt, if only one host is being used use the one hostname in the client_host_list.txt
Update the userid running the job in USER appropriately 
Update the Benchmark_macros.sh to use the correct commands for the Database that has been chosen. (Right now has HBase commands)

Copy the kit over to all the clients that will be used to run the benchmark at the same location.


How to run the benchmark
-------------------------
#./TPCx-IoT-master.sh



Clush Installation
===================

Clush can be installed from EPEL. It is not part of Linux distribution.
Through yum, you can install clush (clustershell) as follows. Please install this on the admin node from 
which the tests will be run and which can access all nodes in the cluster

a) yum-config-manager --add-repo http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/ 
(or yum-config-manager --add-repo http://209.132.181.25/pub/epel/6/x86_64/ incase DNS is not set)
b) yum --nogpgcheck install clustershell -y
c)Include all the nodes in the cluster (e.g. if cluster nodes are rhel1 to rhel16 and rhel18 and rhel21)
echo "all: rhel[1-16,18,21]" > /etc/clustershell/groups

Clush Usage: We have setup "clush"

Usage: clush <options> <shell-commands to run on nodes parallely>
Options:
-a: all nodes (rhel1-rhel16)
-w: specified nodes (-w rhel2 or -w rhel[3-7,9,11-12])
-b: Aggregate results while displaying (example below)
-c: copy files

[root@jumphost Microbench]# clush -a pwd  # Clush command
rhel2: /root
rhel1: /root
rhel4: /root
rhel3: /root
rhel8: /root
rhel7: /root
rhel6: /root
rhel9: /root
rhel5: /root
rhel13: /root
rhel12: /root
rhel11: /root
rhel10: /root
rhel16: /root
rhel15: /root
rhel14: /root

[root@jumphost Microbench]# clush -a -b  pwd  # -b aggregate results/errors and show result condensed
---------------
rhel[1-16] (16)
---------------
/root

clush –a –c <filename> --dest=</root/>   # Clush Copy


Troubleshooting
===============

1.Error running the script (ClassNotFoundException)
—————————————————————————
This is primarily caused due to different Java Versions used by Jar and the java running on the hadoop nodes.
In the zip file jars compiled, one for  Java 1.7.
