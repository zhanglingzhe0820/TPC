#   Here is `machcoordinatoradmin --cluster-status` example.
#   We want to get minimum replication number of each group.
#
#   In this case, each group has 2 normal warehouses. so the final result should be 2.
#   If one of those warehouses goes to 'unknown' or 'scrapped', 
#   then replication factor may be decreased.
